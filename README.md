 Acebook - Team Air
</h1>

<p align="center">
In this group project we were tasked with taking on an existing codebase for a social media app "Acebook" and extending and improving on both the frontend and backend of the app to include new features.</p>

<p align="center">
A significant part of the work included familiairising ourselves with the codebase we inherited and learning and implementing new languages and frameworks within a timeframe of two weeks.</p>

<p align="center">
We also focused heavily on adding styling to make the app more interactive and "user friendly".
